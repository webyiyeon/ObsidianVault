## Checking In on My Goals 🌱

1. How are you feeling this month?  
    (에너지 수준, 멘탈 상태, 전체적인 컨디션은 어땠는지)
    
2. What goals have you started?  
    (작게라도 시작한 것들, 시도만 해본 것도 포함)
    
3. What goals have you not started yet?  
    (아직 손도 못 댄 것들, 미뤄진 이유는 무엇인지)
    
4. What obstacles are in your way?  
    (시간, 체력, 감정, 환경, 우선순위 등)
    
5. How can you realistically overcome those obstacles?  
    (의지를 끌어올리는 게 아니라, 조건을 바꾸는 방식으로)
    
6. Adjustments to goals  
    (이번 달에 기준을 낮추거나, 잠시 빼거나, 새로 추가할 것들)
    
7. TO DO this month in order to move forward  
    (이번 달에 “이것만 하면 잘했다”고 말할 수 있는 최소 행동)
