#### ✨ This Year, I Want To... 

1. Build a healthy body and a healthy mind by exercising around three times a week.
2. Take a short walk after lunch and dinner, even if it’s just 3–5 minutes.
3. Spend at least 10 minutes a day tidying up, regardless of the time of day.
4. Eat my meals on time and log them honestly, without judgment.
5. Engage with Japanese at least once a week, even through light and casual study.
6. Travel abroad in the second half of the year (from June onward).
- Never delay saving money and consistently save at least KRW 600,000 every month.
- Stay committed to my graduate studies by keeping up with classes and assignments.
- Publish one blog post per week and maintain consistency in writing.
- Read at least once a week, even if only for a short time.
